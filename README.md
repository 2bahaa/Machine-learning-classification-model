# Machine-learning-classification-model
This machine learning classification model is designed to classify types of flowers into three categories: 'Setosa', 'Versicolor', and 'Virginica'. It uses sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width as input features. The model achieves an impressive accuracy of 93%, making it a reliable tool for distinguishing between these flower species based on their morphological characteristics. This high accuracy indicates the model's effectiveness in capturing the subtle differences between the flower types.
estimator used was DNN-Classifier (deep neural network classifier) from Tensorflow
